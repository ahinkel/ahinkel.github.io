# DIRAC:  <ins>D</ins>irect pay incentives from the <ins>I</ins>nflation <ins>R</ins>eduction <ins>A</ins>ct for <ins>C</ins>olleges

The following search tool uses data derived from the DoE, IPEDS, and NREL to estimate return on investment for solar arrays on college campuses.  Comparisons are drawn to typical endowments, allowing schools to see the financial benefit of investing in on-campus solar.  The following assumes the array is under 1 MegaWatt in size, and annual energy savings estimates use a nameplate capacity of 80 kW.

PLEASE NOTE: This tool is in beta testing. Other Energy Communities exist that are not taken into account just yet.  Please see the [official website](https://energycommunities.gov/energy-community-tax-credit-bonus/) for more information.

            <ul>
                <li>College and University data comes from IPEDS, the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System. In particular, school locations are from <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/DataFiles.aspx?gotoReportId=7&fromIpeds=true&sid=d96aa052-e8ea-42e0-bf18-91165500f959&rtid=7">Directory information, institutional characteristics, 2022</a>.</li>
                <li>Solar Resource data comes from NREL's <a href="https://maps.nrel.gov/">RE Atlas</a>.</li>
                <li>Energy Community data comes from the US DoE: <a href="https://edx.netl.doe.gov/dataset/dbed5af6-7cf5-4a1f-89bc-a4c17e46256a/resource/4006c9da-f99c-4731-97b2-633cc1578994">Coal Closure Data 2024</a> and <a href="https://edx.netl.doe.gov/dataset/dbed5af6-7cf5-4a1f-89bc-a4c17e46256a/resource/13454403-ef6b-479b-b720-d5e3eaefbb91">MSAs and Non-MSAs and their fossil fuel employment (FFE) and energy community status as of June 7, 2024.</a></li>
                <li>State line shape file data: <a href="https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html">2018 US state 500k</a>.</li>
            </ul>
    
            School data was spatially joined with solar resource data to estimate the potential for solar power on each campus.  The resulting data was then spatially joined with the DoE's energy community data to inform the tax credit available to each institution. Brownfield data is not included.

            These estimates are intended to be a starting point only and are not tax advice.  The data is limited by what is contained in IPEDS, NREL, and DoE data.  Further incentives can be leveraged as well, including:
            <ul>
                <li>US-made materials = additional 10%</li>
                <li>Low-inclome community or Native American land = additional 10%</li>
                <li>Low-income community benefit project = additional 10%</li>
                <li>Brownfield (EPA) status = additional 10% if not already satisfying Energy Community credit.</li>
            </ul>
