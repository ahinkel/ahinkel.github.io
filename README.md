# Austin Hinkel, Ph.D.

Hi there -- I'm Austin Hinkel.  
I am currently a Visiting Assistant Professor at Colorado College studying Galactic Archaeology and Galactic structure. 
I love teaching introductory Physics and Astronomy courses, 
and I am also a huge fan of using data science for social good.


Here is my [CV](https://ahinkel.github.io/assets/pdfs/AustinHinkel_CV_20220929redact.pdf).



### This Site is a Work in Progress
Mostly just parking this here for now.  I'll get around to it eventually.  Maybe.  Anyway, my CV is above.
