# Austin Hinkel, Ph.D.

Hi there -- my name is Austin Hinkel and this is my personal website. 

I am currently a Visiting Assistant Professor at Colorado College studying Galactic Archaeology and Galactic structure.  I love teaching introductory physics and astronomy courses, and I am also a huge fan of using data science for social good.  

This website acts as an abbreviated CV, but I also plan to write about some of my work in astronomy, astrophysics, and data science.  More details on this soon(ish)! 



## Curriculum Vitae:

Here is my full [CV](https://ahinkel.github.io/assets/pdfs/AustinHinkel_CV-9.pdf) as of November 2022.
