# Austin Hinkel, Ph.D.

Hi there -- I'm Austin Hinkel.  

I am currently a Visiting Assistant Professor at Colorado College studying Galactic Archaeology and Galactic structure.  I love teaching introductory Physics and Astronomy courses, and I am also a huge fan of using data science for social good.

### This Site is a Work in Progress
Mostly just parking this here for now.  I'll get around to it eventually.  Maybe.
